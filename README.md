# HTML_challenge

This challenge uses both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. The first part scrapes the titles and preview text from Mars news articles. The second part scrapes and analyzes Mars weather data, which exists in a table. Using pandas and matplotlib, the data is visualized and then exported to a csv file.
